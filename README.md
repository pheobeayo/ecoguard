Product Requirement Document (PRD)

Product Overview:
Ecoguard is a digital platform that utilizes non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to conserve Africa's ecosystem, preventing wildlife extinction and preserving its forests. It allows users to participate in forestry and wildlife conservation efforts by purchasing and trading NFTs representing endangered species such as rhinos, African elephants, cheetahs, mountain gorillas etc. 
Ecoguard leverages blockchain technology; to provide a transparent and secure platform for individuals and organizations to support the protection of endangered species through the creation, trading and ownership of unique digital assets. The funds generated through the sale of these NFTs will be directly allocated to conservation initiatives, ensuring the long-term sustainability of Africa's precious ecosystems.

Problem Statement:
The ecosystem in Africa is under severe threat, leading to the rapid decline of iconic species like the rhino, African elephant, cheetah, mountain gorilla, etc. The African continent is home to diverse and unique wildlife, as well as valuable forestry. However, rampant deforestation, illegal hunting, habitat destruction, and other ecological threats have put many species at risk of extinction and have severely damaged the ecosystem. Existing conservation efforts often struggle to secure sufficient funding and engagement from the global community, leading to a continued decline in wildlife populations and the loss of critical forest areas.

Solution:
Ecoguard offers a novel solution by utilizing the potential of NFTs as a means to fund and support wildlife & forestry conservation projects in Africa. Through Ecoguard, local conservation organizations, researchers, environmentalists, and artists create digital representations of endangered species, iconic landscapes, and other ecological assets;  these NFTs will be made available for sale or auction. Users get to acquire unique digital assets in the form of NFTs, which represent ownership or support for specific conservation initiatives as a portion of the proceeds from the sale of these NFTs will directly support initiatives focused on protecting and restoring their natural habitats, combating poaching, and promoting engagement in conservation efforts.

Product Objectives:
  Enable individuals and organizations to support wildlife conservation efforts in Africa.
  Generate funds to protect and restore the habitats of endangered species.
   Promote transparency and accountability in the allocation of conservation resources.
